abstract: >
  This working monograph argues that consciousness, as conventionally conceived,
  is a category error arising from grammatical reification. The framework treats
  phenomenological concepts as evolutionary narratives serving coordination
  functions rather than detected ontological properties. Drawing on eliminative
  materialism, illusionism, Wittgenstein's language games, and computational
  approaches, the paper dissolves the 'hard problem' by showing it emerges from
  nominalization of processes into pseudo-entities. Key contributions include
  consciousness as memetic narrative with attractor-basin stability, Gödelian
  analysis of phenomenological self-reference, evidence from LLM phenomenology
  discourse, and vocabulary reform converting nominalized concepts to process
  descriptions.
